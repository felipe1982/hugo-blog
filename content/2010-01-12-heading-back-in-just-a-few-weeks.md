I&#8217;m flying back to Brissy soon, it feels good. I miss so many people back &#8216;home&#8217;. Some I&#8217;ve spoken with many times since I came back to Canada, some only just a few. I appreciate the friends I have, and I&#8217;m thankful for them.

I have yet to meet many of my Canadian friends. Many Hamilton friends I have not yet seen, and long to see. I shall see them soon, with luck.

I have been enjoying this time off very much. I have done nothing but slack off, eat like crap, sleep in &#8217;till noon everyday, go out with friends, watch movies, go to bars, go to cottage. No snow shoveling, no work, no classes, no trips to grocery store. Just bliss.

I have enjoyed my time here, but I miss Brissy. It will be good to be back &#8212; warm too! ðŸ˜‰
