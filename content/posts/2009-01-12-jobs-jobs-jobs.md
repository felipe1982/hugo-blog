Searching for work is a PITA (pain in the ass). 38 resumes, and 8 left. I gave about 30 resumes at the Indooroopilly mall, and a Toowong. Most places weren&#8217;t hiring &#8212; they were overstaffed from Chistmas time. Right now, _where_ I work is not as important as finding a job ASAP. I need to pay rent!

Yvonne bought a printer. Printed 20 more resumes, today I&#8217;m handing them out. I&#8217;m also posting ads for my computer services anywhere I find an empty pole!

Getting internet this week, so I can post more often!

Happy New Years to you and your family. Sorry i didn&#8217;t send mass-produced e-mails to you! We miss you!
