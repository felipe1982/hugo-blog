Since I don&#8217;t have an iPhone, and I don&#8217;t use windows, I&#8217;m not quite sure what to make of [free long distance phone calls with iCall][1]. If you want to download it, install it, and use it, let me know how it functions. Or if you already have experience with it, give me a little feedback. Is it worth it? How is the call quality? Do they spam you? Is it really &#8216;free&#8217;? What restrictions does it have? Does it cut off your calls after 30 mins?

> iCall uses Voice Over IP (VoIP) technology which utilizes your existing Internet connection (cable, DSL, wireless, or dial-up) and your PC to plug you directly in to the regular telephone network. Stick it to the man &#8211; you already pay for your Internet connection, and the Internet is changing everything!_
