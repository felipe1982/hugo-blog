Hot day.  34 degrees.  Went to [Toowong][1] today to look at places to live.  We didn&#8217;t find much, either really sloppy and run down, or not furnished.  We&#8217;d prefer a furnished place, since we don&#8217;t have to worry about moving fridges, stoves, beds around when/if we decide to move out and find another place.  We also do not want to pay more than $400/week (all rental units are priced _per week_). That would be divided between 3 people.

Swimming in the afternoon was a delight.  Water was warm, although Yvonne&#8217;s uncle put a tad too much sodium bicarbonate in the water to settle the pH level a bit.  If you&#8217;ve ever tasted baking soda you know what I mean.

Yvonne has been suffering a bit from the jet lag.  She&#8217;s very tired all day everyday since we arrived, and her stomach was feeling very upset.
