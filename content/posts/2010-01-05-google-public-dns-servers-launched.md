Today, Google has announced the launch of their free DNS resolution service. Many ISPs and 3rd party provider such as OpenDNS snoops around or send traffic to ad servers. However, Google promises not to play with end users and send the exact response his or her computer expects without performing any blocking, filtering, or redirection that may hamper a user&#8217;s browsing experience. In other words Google will not hijacking your traffic on non-existent domain name and it will follow strict RFC standard. Thank you [NixCraft][1]

Here&#8217;s looking at you TELSTRA!
