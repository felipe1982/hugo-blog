<img class="alignleft" title="hushmail-logo" src="http://www.hushmail.com/pics/logo.gif" alt="" width="210" height="50" />Hushmail, a Canadian company providing email security using <acronym title="Pretty Good Privacy">PGP</acronym>, has [released to the US government _**unencrypted email communications**_][1]. This respresents a violation of users&#8217; trust in the company. I had an account with them, I will delete all my mail, and close that account. I will only trust my own computer for safe email sending/receiving. No longer will I trust the &#8216;security&#8217; and &#8216;privacy&#8217; of a third-party.
