Flight was good. Good food, Good service. I&#8217;m very happy with korean Airlines, and I&#8217;d travel with them again, just maybe not from Toronto to Brisbane (Brisbane to Toronto, however, was flawless, arguably the best flight I&#8217;ve ever taken in my life).

These are pictures of the free Hotel room Korean Air set me up with. I had to wait 16 hours for my next flight. They provided me with a free lunch coupon, but I got hungry by 7:00 AM and just looked for a decent local joint to satisfy my kimchee and bibimbap craving.

Excuse the poor quality pics &#8211; they were taken with my laptop&#8217;s webcam.
