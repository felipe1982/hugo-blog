I can feel Brizzy getting colder now, as April begins to close. May will be stressful, with assignments and group work. Overall, this semester has been among my easiest. Reminds me of my final year as undergrad in Canada. I took French, Spanish, and Philosophy &#8211; what a breeze! Cairns coming up. Promise I&#8217;ll post up underwater pics 😉
