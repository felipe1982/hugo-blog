I&#8217;ve been in Australia for two months now (came Dec 4th). So far things are going smoother than I could have expected. We found place to live rather quickly, although there are other suitable places, we didn&#8217;t want to spend more time &#038; effort searching, inspecting, and filling out applications. This one was available, so we took it.

Another job offered me around $16/hr, including 4 weeks vacation (the norm around here), sick pay (normal as well), and a business car to drive around Brisbane. I told him &#8220;no&#8221; because i found another job requiring _no_ quotas, hardly any major responsibilities, and $19/hr. I figured, for the 6-12 months that I will be working in Brisbane, I&#8217;ll take the $19/hr.

I submitted my application to [OzTrekk][1] yesterday. It should arrive there in about 2 weeks, and tomorrow I should find out how much time it will take before I will be notified of weather or not I got in.

Chatting with the folks Sunday should be a lot of fun. My webcam isn&#8217;t working (yet) with opensuse 11.1 (it worked with 11.0 so I don&#8217;t get it). I&#8217;ll get it sooner or later, but for now I might need to borough EVs laptop/webcam so I can skype my family back home.

Australia is suffereing some strange weather &#8212; hurricanes (called cyclones around the pacific), droughts in some parts, floods in others, fires. It is affecting crops, and prices at my store have been bouncing like yo-yo&#8217;s.

Mentally, I am focussed on working, earning some money, paying for my food/rent/etc. Nextly, I will look at P.R. (permanent residency) to see if I can take my Masters program as a domestic student (and pay 50% tuition)
