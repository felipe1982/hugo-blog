It&#8217;s week 8 now at Uni, out of 13 weeks in all. The pressure will come in around two weeks, I think. CCNA case study, CCNA practicals, Computer Forenics Project report (80% of my mark), 20% for Computer Forensic presentation, around 30-40% for surviving group attacks from Advanced Network Management (aka GNU Linux server management). All in all, a laid-back semester.

Heading out to Cairns on Saturday. Stoked! Going scuba diving.
