I am currently sitting in my I.T. Project Management class where we are learning about PRINC<span id="sample-permalink">E2</span> project management methodology. And so far (in 5 weeks) I have learned little. There is an (optional) exam coming up so we can be certified in PRINCE2, but we have been given no suggested readings, although they have sold over 70 textbooks for students to study. Of course, google helped me read the book for free &#8230;

I phoned one of my references today to give him a gentle and polite kick in the butt: 2 weeks and he has not submitted the reference email given to him by the University of Queensland. I&#8217;m dying for a new job, one that pays more, has better hours, reflects my interests in I.T., closer to home, cleaner, quieter, easier. ohh.
