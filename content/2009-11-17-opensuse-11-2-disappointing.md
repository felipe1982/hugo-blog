I must say I found openSUSE 11.2 to be a major disappointment. I&#8217;ve come to expect better, much better, from Novell. If it weren&#8217;t for the stability issues with KDE and relatively poor netbook support this distribution would have been a keeper for me. There really is a lot to like. Perhaps the results will be different for people with different hardware. For me, though, openSUSE 11.2 just doesn&#8217;t compare favorably to the other major distributions and I can&#8217;t recommend it at this time.
