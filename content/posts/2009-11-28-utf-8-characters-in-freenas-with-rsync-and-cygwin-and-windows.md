I&#8217;ve been having some problems with charsets (character sets) when using FreeNAS, rsync, deltacopy, and cygwin.

The filenames on a Windows box are either in UTF-8 or ISO-8859-1 (Latin1). The FreeNAS uses rsync to backup the files on the windows box, and saves them to a RAID array. I wasn&#8217;t sure if it was rsync, or FreeNAS causing the problem, but all characters with more than 7 significant bits (8 or more) were being &#8220;escaped&#8221; such as **\#303** instead of **Ã‘**.

I found the solution by using the &#8220;-8&#8221; flag in rsync. Also, I overwrote the cygwin.dll file supplied by DeltaCopy with a [UTF-8-modified cygwin.dll][1], restarted DeltaCopy, and the filenames appeared correctly _and_ in UTF-8 (instead of ISO8859-1).

As always, remember to BACKUP before journeying on with this! Good Luck!
