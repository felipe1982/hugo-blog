There was nothing special about today.Â  We looked at another place, it was another shit hole.Â  We arrived before the guy showed up. Good! It was awful.Â  We took off and grabbed some food.Â  It was nearly 6:30 pm and we were really hungry.

It wasn&#8217;t so hot today as it was on previous days.Â  I&#8217;m feeling tired as the days wear on. I&#8217;m not sure what it could be. Boredom? Laziness? My resume needs tidying. I&#8217;ll work on it later ðŸ˜‰

I miss my friends and family back home.Â  I can&#8217;t remember all your addresses, but if you **comment on my post with your address** I would be very happy to send you a lovely postcard from Australia! Don&#8217;t be shy! COMMENT!
