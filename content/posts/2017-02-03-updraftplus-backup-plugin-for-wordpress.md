UpdraftPlus seems to be a promising backup plugin, with a daily/weekly/&#8230; schedule for backing up database, as well as wordpress files. I&#8217;m not happy with the way Google makes it hard for these plugins to work with them. For this reason I was forced to select Dropbox as the remote backup destination, instead of Google Drive. S3 is also an option.

I&#8217;d give it 5 stars overall.
