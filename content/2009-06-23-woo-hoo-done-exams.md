It feels so good to be done Semester 1 Year 1 at QUT. I finally feel like I have accomplished something, and I feel like I accomplished a lot.

  1. Cryptology &#8211; learning the mathematics and concepts behind cryptography, the basis of information security techniques, technology, and protocols.
  2. Security &#8211; understanding the reasons to enforce security policies, and the myriad ways in which to use information security models.
  3. Digital Forensics &#8211; looked at the things forensic investigators have to face and to consider when collecting digital evidence. Looked at various methods of collecting digital evidence, and the obstacles an investigator must try to overcome to gain as much evidence as possible, without tampering or destroying it to ensure it is admissible as evidence in a court of law.
  4. Project Management &#8211; I&#8217;m just glad its over!
