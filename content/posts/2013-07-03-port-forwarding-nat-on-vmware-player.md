The previous webpage I was using to help me with making custom configurations to my [NAT for my virtual machines][1] is no longer viable for Version 5. However, after upgrading to version 5, I had to follow these directions:

> In VMWare Player 5 you need to:

> rundll32.exe vmnetui.dll VMNetUI_ShowStandalone
