I&#8217;m getting totally knocked down by all the shit I have going on over the next 11 days. Nov 7th, I have two exams, one for Network Administration (GNU), and one Cicso CCNA exam. On Nov 5th, I have two Cisco CCNA exams. Nov 3rd, I have a Security exam worth 50% of my grade. On Nov 2nd I have an Advanced Cryptology exam also worth 50%. On October 30th, my Cisco CCNA case study report is due. On October 26th I have a Advanced Cryptology presentation on Enigma. I work Oct 23th, 24th, 25th. Today is Oct 22nd.

Can you do the math?

## Strategy:

My strategy is to read one lecture for Crypto and Security every day, for 12 days. This way I have a hope of getting a decent mark on those exams, as they are the ones coming up. A colleague of mine from my UNIX/GNU class wants to start going over some of the sample questions posted on BlackBoard. I had to politely decline as I have no more room on my plate atm. I&#8217;ll have some time on Nov4th, and Nov6th to lay out some time for GNU and CCNA.

## Opinion:

It isn&#8217;t fair. The university should have a &#8220;no lectures, presentations, or assignments seven days before first exam&#8221; policy. Maybe they do, I&#8217;ll have to investigate.
