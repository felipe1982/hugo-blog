<span style="font-style: italic;">The only reason Microsoft software is the target of so many viruses is because it is so widely used! Why, if Linux or Mac OS X was as popular as Windows, there would be just as many viruses written for those platforms!</span>

Do YOU agree with this statement? This article at [TheRegister][1] tries to disprove that &#8216;myth&#8217;.

I&#8217;ve had this conversation with many people. The point I try to make, is that Microsoft and other HW and SW vendors rub each others backs, and make millions for unsuspecting losers clamoring for the latest anti-virus update, or newest $60 cd/dvd burning software. HW and SW vendors put cute <span style="font-style: italic;">Windows Vista Capable</span> stickers on everything they sell (read: routers, switches, and mice). Microsoft creates a shoddy O.S. so that others can profit from covering up the cracks, gaps, and holes.
