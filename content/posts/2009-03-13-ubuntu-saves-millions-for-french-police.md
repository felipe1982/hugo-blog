[French Police save Millions switching to Ubuntu][1]

_The French national police force, the Gendarmerie Nationale, has spoken about their migration [away from the Windows platform to Linux][2]. Estimated to have already saved the force 50 Million Euros, the migration is due to be completed on all 90,000 workstations by 2015. Of the move, Lt. Col. Guimard had this comment: &#8220;Moving from Microsoft XP to Vista would not have brought us many advantages and Microsoft said it would require training of users. Moving from XP to Ubuntu, however, proved very easy. The two biggest differences are the icons and the games. Games are not our priority.&#8221;_
