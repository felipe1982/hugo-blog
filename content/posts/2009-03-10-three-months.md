I&#8217;ve officially been in Brisbane three months. This will be short post to keep my appreciative fans happy. I&#8217;m studying full time at [Queensland university of Technology][1] in Brisbane. Taking _Computer Forensics_, _Cryptology and Algorithms_, _I.T. Project Management_, and _Information Security_. The courses are all challenging, and interesting, and homework is beginning to pile up.

I have an interview later today with UQ about an IT Help Desk position. I hope it goes well&#8230;

My boss at Fruity Capers cut my hours from about 40hrs/week to about 13hrs/week, and so I am in need of _a little_ more work. We&#8217;ll see how my interview at UQ goes. Apprarently, it pays $26/hr.

I can feel the weather lowering slightly, nights are cooler, and when it rains it feels cooler too. I think winter won&#8217;t be too bad around here.

Oh well, Ta-Ta for now
