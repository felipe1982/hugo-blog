I&#8217;m working at Fruity Capers, a fruit stand inside the mall. Only a 25 min walk from my house. They will (likely) pay about $20/hr, and give me 5 days a week. But I am not sure how many hours per week I will be getting.

Internet comes on Monday, and I have my overseas visitor health coverage now. Next I will apply for my international drivers licence. Everything is working out.

I had an interview on Tuesday for a job with _OzSpy_ selling security cameras and equipment. I have a feeling it would not pay much more than Fruity Capers, and I would need to travel more, and work more, and actually persuade people to buy things &#8212; _&#8220;salesmanship&#8221;_.

Yvonne starts school Monday, and I start work Monday as well! Thinks are falling into place.
