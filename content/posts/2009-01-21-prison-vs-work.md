Just in case you ever get these two environments mixed up, this should make things a little bit clearer.

@ PRISON

You spend most of your time

in a 10X10 cell

@ WORK
  
You spend most of your time
  
in an 6X6 cubicle

@ PRISON
  
You get three meals a day, fully paid for

@ WORK
  
You get a break for one meal and
  
you have to pay for it

@ PRISON
  
For good behavior, you get time off

@ WORK
  
For good   behavior,
  
you get more work

@ PRISON
  
The guard unlocks and locks all the doors for you

@ WORK
  
You must carry a security card
  
and open all the doors yourself

@ PRISON
  
You can watch TV and play games

@WORK
  
You could get fired for watching
  
TV and playing games

@ PRISON
  
You get your own toilet

@ WORK
  
You have to share the toilet with
  
people who pee on the seat

@ PRISON
  
They allow your family and friends to visit

@ WORK
  
You aren&#8217;t even supposed to
  
speak to your family

@ PRISON
  
All expenses are paid by the taxpayers with no work required

@ WORK
  
You must pay all your expenses to go
  
to work, and they deduct taxes from
  
your salary to pay for prisoners

@ PRISON
  
You spend most of your life inside bars wanting
  
to get out

@ WORK
  
You spend most of your time
  
wanting to get out and
  
go inside bars

@ PRISON
  
You must deal with sadistic wardens

@ WORK
  
They are called &#8216;managers&#8217;

Now get back to work. You&#8217;re not getting paid to check emails
