In the last installment we looked at GNU find&#8217;s perm test, which checks the permissions on files and directories. To recap, there are three main options under the perm test

  1. perm 755 — absolute. Print files or directories that have the exact file permissions &#8216;755&#8217; (rwxr-xr-x)
  2. perm /444 — at least (OR). Print files that have at least the read bit on user **_or_** group **_or _**other.
  3. perm -644 — mimimum (AND). Print files or directories that have all these bits set, or more.
