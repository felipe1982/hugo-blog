We must find a place to live as soon as possible.  We have an 11:00AM appointment today to view an apartment. We are calling some other places to arrange something with them. Prospects are looking better, some include [6/173 Macquarie St][1] (St. Lucia), [6/53 Alpha St][2] (Taringa), [6/5 Norwood St][3] (Toowong).

Yvonne&#8217;s Aunt and Uncle took us out for steak yesterday. You don&#8217;t have to _tip_ anybody here. It&#8217;s fantastic! What-you-see-is-what-you-pay WYSIWYP. If your steak is $29.90 you pay _**$29.90**_. It is so fantastic

However &#8230;

Waiters tend to forget about you, or don&#8217;t top-up your water, or don&#8217;t check up to see &#8220;how things are going&#8221; so I tend to miss that, but that should be included, not an &#8220;extra&#8221; fee, wouldn&#8217;t you agree? Who do you tip and why?
