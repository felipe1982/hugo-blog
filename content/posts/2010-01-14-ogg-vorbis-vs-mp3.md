I just ripped some of my CD&#8217;s to MP3, but I was just curious what OGG would do for me. I had never actually compared the two encoding formats, side-by-side, but today, I was simply stunned.

A song compressed with MP3 (VBR 128Kbps Normal Quality) was around 5.1 &#8211; 5.8 MB. It sounded good, but &#8216;clearly&#8217; inferior to the actual CD Quality sound.

The OGG rip (VBR 128Kbps), on the other hand knocked my socks off! It was around 3.0 &#8211; 3.1 MB and sounded &#8216;nearly&#8217; as good as the original CD!

I hesitated, at first, to rip them all to MP3, in case I wanted to share them (!gasp!) with others. However, now that I can see a 17% &#8211; 20% compression gain using OGG over MP3, I no longer feel that way. I wholeheartedly endorse the use of OGG Vorbis for ALL compressed lossy compression.

Most [good] audio/multimedia players already support OGG (except, MS programs, obviously!) so you should have no problem listening to them.

If you have a portable media player (PMP) without native OGG support there are two options

  1. Contact the manuafaturer and demand (request?) that they support OGG in future versions of their players
  2. Ask them to create a firmware update to include OGG support on currently supported players
  3. Install [Rockbox][1]: a Linux-based GNU open-source free software suite which allows many major PMP&#8217;s to play a _huge variety_ of free and proprietary (i.e. non-free, patented, or otherwise &#8216;encumbered&#8217;) formats, such as OGG. It also allows you to play wide variety of video formats, as well. It included a bunch of interesting features such as backlight dimming, battery-saving features, audio enhancement features, and plenty of games (plays DOOM too!)
