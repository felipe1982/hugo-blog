The reason that beating Linux is the highest priority at Redmond is that unlike, Novell, Netscape, Corel, Lotus or any of Microsoft&#8217;s previous targets, there has been no obvious company to blow away, no means to starve the competition into submission. And, unlike these other targets, Microsoft is not winning. Linux has grown in influence, and things look to get worse, not better, for Microsoft in the short term. <http://www.linux.com/feature/20520>
