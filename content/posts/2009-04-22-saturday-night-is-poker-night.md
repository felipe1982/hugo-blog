I&#8217;m having some people over on Saturday night for a social poker game. I already bought food and snacks, they were on sale last week. Since I couldn&#8217;t bring my own poker chips (they weight a tonne), I borrowed some from a friend, but they are only 100! Which means, if there are 10 people, only 10 chips each! Not even CLOSE to enough for a game. I might need 300 or so. I will see if I can buy then return, but that won&#8217;t be likely. i&#8217;ll just buy and keep very cheap ones. Cards aren&#8217;t a problem, I have my own Copags. Chairs could be an issue, but I&#8217;ll borrow from the downstairs neighbours just in case there aren&#8217;t enough.
