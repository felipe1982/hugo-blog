I leave for Australia in under a week. I&#8217;m pretty excited, and I think some time away from the ordinary should be good for me. I&#8217;ll settle with a waiting/bar job, or tourism might be fun, if it lets me spend some time outdoors and kill my abs a bit ðŸ˜‰ Ideally, I&#8217;d like to gain some experience in an ITC (Information Technology Communications) job, but I will have to convince an employer that emplyoing me for just 6 months will be worthwhile to them.

In any case, I&#8217;ve got money saved up, and I&#8217;ve got the balls and skill and will to earn money, and spend it wisely. I will be looking forward to studying at UQ. I will need to ask them how they see my chances of getting accepted to the program.
