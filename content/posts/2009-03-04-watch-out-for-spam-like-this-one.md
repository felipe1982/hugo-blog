I woke up this morning to check my email. In it, I received this strange e-mail message. This is purely spam (because its African haha =). Always treat your e-mails with respect, and never carelessly click on links, or reply to people you do not know. They may not know that they have hit a &#8216;live&#8217; email, but when you reply, now they know that it is &#8216;real&#8217; and will spread the news, and you will get even _more_ spam. I want to post this, hopefully as a lesson to Mr Osatoh esq, and hopefully spam harvesters will pick up his email address and start spamming _him_.

My Dear Alvarez,

I am Barrister Frank Osatoh ,a solicitor at law, personal attorney to Mr.J.C. Alvarez , a national of your country,who used to work as a contractor in Lome Togo.

Here in after shall be referred to as my client. On the 24th of June 2007, my client, his wife and his only daughter died in a motor accident along Kpalime express Road.Since then I have made several enquiries here to locate any of my clients extended relatives,

this has also proved unsuccessful.After these several unsuccessful attempts,I decided to searcht-through with his name which motivated me to contact you, to locate any member of his family hence I contacted you.I have contacted you to assist in repartrating the fund valued at US$ 9.5 million left behind by my client before it gets confisicated or declared unserviceable by the bank where this huge amount were deposited.

The said bank has issued me a notice to provide the next of kin or have his account confisicated within the next twenty one official working days.

Since I have been unsuccesfull in locating the relatives for over 2 years now, I seek the consent to present you as the next of kin to the deceased since you have the same last name, so that the proceeds of this account can be paid to you.Therefore, on receipt of your positive response, we shall then discuss the sharing ratio and modalities for transfer.

I have all necessary information and legal documents needed to back you up for this claim. All I require from you is your honest co-operation to enable us see this transaction through. I guarantee that this will be executed under legitimate arrangement that will protect you from any breach of the law.
