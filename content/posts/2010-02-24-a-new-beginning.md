I got hired at my old job. I&#8217;m very happy for that. They&#8217;re happy I came back! Saves them money and time on training, and the off-chance of hiring a &#8216;lemon&#8217; that quits after 4 weeks. I&#8217;ve entered into a Digital Forensics project. I need to develop a tool that will automate some of the labourious tasks involved in digital forensic evidence acquisition. I&#8217;ll probably need to brush up on GNU Bash scripting, and PHP.

It&#8217;s been very warm here, but not too hot, which I like. Yesterday was a bitch, though, felt like 30Â°C. Fortunately, today was overcast, and so helped to alleviate some of the scorching.
