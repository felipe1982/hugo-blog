In an historic move, Microsoft Monday submitted driver source code for inclusion in the [Linux kernel][1] under a GPLv2 license.

The code consists of four drivers that are part of a technology called Linux Device Driver for Virtualization. The drivers, once added to the Linux kernel, will provide the hooks for any distribution of Linux to run on Windows Server 2008 and its Hyper-V hypervisor technology. Microsoft will provide ongoing maintenance of the code.

Linux backers hailed the submission as validation of the Linux development model and the Linux GPLv2 licensing.

Microsoft said the move will foster more open source on Windows and help the vendor offer a consistent set of virtualization, management and administrative tools to support mixed virtualized infrastructure.

Kroah-Hartman said Microsoft&#8217;s submission was routine. &#8220;They abided by every single rule and letter of what we require to submit code. If I was to refuse this code it would be wrong,&#8221; he said.

Sam Ramji, who runs the Open Source Software Lab for Microsoft and is the company&#8217;s director of open source technology strategy, called the Linux kernel submission the company&#8217;s most important Linux/open source commitment ever.<!--more-->

&#8220;It is a significant piece of technology. It is a strategic technology and it is under the GPLv2 license that the Linux kernel uses, and which the community is organized around.&#8221;

Kroah-Hartman called the submission a milestone for Linux because &#8220;Microsoft is publicly stating that GPLv2 is a valid development license and something that is acceptable for contributing code. It validates our development model and that makes me very happy.&#8221;

Linux Foundation boss Zemlin echoed those comments and said, &#8220;This is the culmination of a Microsoft that realizes they need to work with others to succeed.&#8221;

And over the past year, Microsoft has made its first ever code submission to the PHP community and become one of only three Platinum sponsors of the Apache Foundation.

The drivers will make it easier to support Linux guest operating systems in their emerging cloud infrastructure, and it will guarantee Windows is a part of every enterprise conversation around virtual Linux servers.

And virtualization integration baked into the Linux kernel appears to provide Microsoft with a heavy stick with which to beat up VMware.

&#8220;Why should Microsoft let a religious distaste for Linux get in the way of making a lot of money on Windows Server 2008 being the hypervisor under all those Linux servers?&#8221; asked Jeffrey Hammond, an analyst with Forrester Research. &#8220;Microsoft&#8217;s desire to take money away from VMware and other alternatives has outweighed its distaste for embracing Linux and the GPL. That is a sign of the opportunity they see here.&#8221;

Microsoft, however, won&#8217;t have an exclusive on virtualization drivers in Linux. VMware has certified kernel mode para-virtualization drivers but administrators have to install them separately because they are not part of the mainline Linux kernel.
  
&#8220;Microsoft is taking a short cut,&#8221; said Chris Wolf, an analyst with the Burton Group.&#8221;This is a big deal. When you get in the mainline Linux kernel it is a competitive advantage for Microsoft.&#8221;

Microsoft&#8217;s Ramji used a gentler spin. &#8220;We see more opportunity to work together and grow open source on the Microsoft platform,&#8221; he said.

Ramji called virtualization a crucial technology for consolidation in the data center. &#8220;The question becomes am I going to pick multiple versions of virtualization technology; one for each operating system or workload, and if I do that, will I get the benefit that I need? Or can I pick one virtualization technology, one management technology and have one set of skills to support that whole infrastructure regardless if it is Unix, Linux or Windows running on top of it. We can clearly and consistently state we are a great choice to be your virtualization infrastructure provider.&#8221;
