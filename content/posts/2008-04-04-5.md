I&#8217;m pretty stoked about my PS2. I&#8217;ve been playing lots of very good games lately &#8211; especially some of the great classics. I don&#8217;t regret now having played these games before. I did other amazing things before.

God of War was excellent. Lots of cool enemies, beautiful puzzles, cool landscapes, killer story line. Kratos is a bad ass, with pimpin&#8217; chains.

Bully is pretty fun &#8211; albeit childish

Need For Speed: Carbon is very exciting. I&#8217;m trying to win all the pink slips.

Prince of persia. There&#8217;s an excellent adventure. More thinking than fighting &#8211; fighting always an important part. Solid adventure, solid storyline. Prince of persia sands of time is the game I aim to beat now.

All of these games are playing from my HD. A most excellent invention. Props to the teams from HD loader, WinHIIP, [Console Exploits][1]. Thanks to Sony for a killer system, and for all the software developers. If the games were only half the price, I might just buy them &#8230;
