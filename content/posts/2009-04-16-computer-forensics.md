I am presently working on an assigment I have due on Sunday. It involves located and recoving 9 illegal images from a 256 flash drive image. The image was passed through FTK (Forensics ToolKit) and about 6 images were recovered easily. Another one which took some effort, was only a duplicate of another one already discovered. One more was steganographically hidden, and using stegbreak I discovered the password PANDA. JpHS was used to open the image and separate the two images from each other revealing another illegal image. 8 in total, and I stuggle to find the last one.
