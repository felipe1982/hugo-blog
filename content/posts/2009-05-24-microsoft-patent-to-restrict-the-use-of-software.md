theodp writes &#8220;On Tuesday, [Microsoft was granted US Patent No. 7,536,726][1] (it was filed in 2005) for **intentionally crippling the functionality of an operating system** by &#8216;making selected portions and functionality of the operating system unavailable to the user or by limiting the user&#8217;s ability to add software applications or device drivers to the computer&#8217; until an &#8216;agreed upon sum of money&#8217; is paid to &#8216;unlock or otherwise make available the restricted functionality.&#8217; According to Microsoft, this solves a &#8216;problem inherent in open architecture systems,&#8217; i.e., &#8216;they are generally licensed with complete use rights and/or functionality that may be beyond the need or desire of the system purchaser.&#8217; An additional problem with open architecture systems, Microsoft explains, is that &#8216;virtually anyone can write an application that can be executed on the system.&#8217; Nice to see the USPTO rewarding Microsoft&#8217;s eight problem-solving inventors, including Linux killer (and antelope killer) Joachim Kempin, who&#8217;s been credited with getting Microsoft hauled into federal court on antitrust charges.&#8221; Sounds like the mechanism by which Microsoft sells one version of Vista to all users, and lets users upgrade to higher-tier flavors of the OS after cash changes hands.

Key concepts to take out of this:

  1. limiting the user&#8217;s ability to add software applications or device drivers to the computer 
      * Don&#8217;t you own your own computer? Aren&#8217;t you permitted to add whatever you feel like? Who has the <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><em>right</em></span> to revoke this right on your behalf?
  2. functionality that may be beyond the need or desire [of the end user] 
      * What I want, or what are need, are none of your business unless I ask for it.
  3. virtually anyone can write an application that can be executed on the system. 
      * Why is that so bad?
  4. Move to [free][2] [software][3]! 
      * It feels good.
