We&#8217;ve been busy! Buying dishes, sauce pans, pots, food, bed sheets. We borrowed a fan from Yvonne&#8217;s Aunt Ding, and we are keeping cool at night. We&#8217;ve been walking a tremendous amount for a few reasons, some of which include no money for public transport, and a good way to burn away some calories and hours.

Christmas here was unusual, for Yvonne mostly I think. It just didn&#8217;t _feel_ like Christmas. They play carols in the malls, but not like we are used to. They play them softly, or sparsely, so they are less prominent than other sounds or music. Obviously it is Summer time in Oz; 35 or more degrees, no snow, with some showers, and a heavy dose of humidity. It just wasn&#8217;t a Christmas we&#8217;ve ever experienced. Yvonne has her tiny red and white stocking out though, to comemorate these Christian times (she&#8217;s Taoist/Buddhist).

We spent Christmas at Auntie Ding&#8217;s house, with about 25 other guests. The young crowd sat at the kitchen, while the &#8220;adults&#8221; sat at the dining-room table. We enjoyed lasagne, satay chicken, three salad varieties, butter cookies, beer and juice. Yvonne and I got a few gifts too.

We have an apartment now, and although the unit holds 7 bedrooms in all, many of the other tenants are either away on vacation, or their rooms are vacant.

My time at the Public Library&#8217;s internet session is about to expire in 3 min 50 sec. So until next time,
