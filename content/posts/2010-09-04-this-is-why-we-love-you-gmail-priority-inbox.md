    Gmail has always been pretty good at filtering junk mail into the &#8220;spam&#8221; folder. But today, in addition to spam, people get a lot of mail that isn&#8217;t outright junk but isn&#8217;t very important&#8211;bologna, or &#8220;bacn.&#8221; So we&#8217;ve evolved Gmail&#8217;s filter to address this problem and extended it to not only classify outright spam, but also to help users separate this &#8220;bologna&#8221; from the important stuff. In a way, Priority Inbox is like your personal assistant, helping you focus on the messages that matter without requiring you to set up complex rules.&#8221;

  <p>
    The Priority Inbox segregates Gmail into three different categories: &#8220;Important and Unread&#8221;, &#8220;Starred&#8221;, and &#8220;Everything Else&#8221;. Gmail automatically filters incoming e-mail into either &#8220;Important and Unread&#8221; or &#8220;Everything Else&#8221;, while the middle category is populated by those messages that have been flagged for future reference.
