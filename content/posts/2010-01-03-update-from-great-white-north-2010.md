I have been very much enjoying my time with family and friends. Only a few friends I have not yet seen. One has moved somewhat far, and I haven&#8217;t seen him in several years. He got married, and now has a new baby daughter. I&#8217;d like to see them perhaps on Sunday.

I&#8217;ve been keeping very busy, haven&#8217;t fully optimised my available time, but I&#8217;m fine with that. Planning isn&#8217;t really my strong point. I haven&#8217;t been studying C++ like I said I would, nor touched PHP. A few rounds of poker have stimulated me, winning +$50 the first night, and +$25 the second (.25/.50 NL cash 10 players).

I have just 5 weeks to go. A trip to the cottage starts Tuesday, until Saturday. But sister and her fianc√© won&#8217;t arrive until Friday (night) and so Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday (and a part of Friday) will be reading books and watching movies (as if I haven&#8217;t done enough of that&#8230;)

I hope I can get my job back when I return to Brisbane. In the worst case, I can apply to work at QUT helpdesk, but I don&#8217;t want to push trolleys up and down delivering student assignments (for less pay).

I miss so many people back in Australia. This is a good thing, it&#8217;s good to miss people I care about, and good to be missed back.
