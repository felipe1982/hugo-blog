If anybody reading this has been curious of macro-meteorological medians (average climates and temperatures) visit [ACU][1]. They have interesting facts which I never knew, like:

> Brisbane has a humid subtropical climate with hot, humid summers and dry, mild winters. The city&#8217;s highest recorded temperature was 43.2°C on the 26 January 1940 and its **coldest was -0.1°C on 9 July 2007**, which was the first time Brisbane&#8217;s temperature fell below freezing point.

Beautiful! a near-zero probability for snow and freezing temps! [Brisbane-australia.com][2] has more statistics like:

> June/July/August &#8211; Winter
  
> Mean temperature: 15.60 C
  
> Max average temperature: 21.20 C
  
> Min average temperature: **10.10 C** 

Hardly ever less than 10C in the winter! Rock on!
