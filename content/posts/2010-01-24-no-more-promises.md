I will _never again buy_ a RAID Controller card from Promise again! They claimed to support GNU/Linux, and they don&#8217;t. They said they didn&#8217;t have drivers for Windows 7, and then suddenly they magically appear on their Downloads page. We weren&#8217;t even notified.

I&#8217;m going to go with mdadm and try my luck with software RAID on Mint. If I _must_ buy another card, for whatever reason (namely software RAID is much too slow, and hardware RAID will offload the work to the card itself) I&#8217;ll go with Adaptec.
