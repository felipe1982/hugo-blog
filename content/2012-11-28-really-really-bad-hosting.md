This is like instant death. Lose money. That’s right. _**Even if you lose money on a client or customer, that one individual can bad mouth you globally today.**_ Check out Angieslist.com if you don’t believe it. You may lose some cash up front but, again, a happy client is your best salesperson – and they’re FREE. Sweet.

Emphasis mine.
