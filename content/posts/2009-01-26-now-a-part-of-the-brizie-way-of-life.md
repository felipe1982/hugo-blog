Finished my first week at my new job. I plan to upload some pics of my workplace and my snazzy new uniform! I think it should pay around $20/hr. THat&#8217;s what the other employees are making, so I think I should get the same pay. I only got about 23 hours last week. They were training me on a bunch of new things. Unloading the truck with fruits and veggies, putting them away in the fridge, stacking them correctly. There are 5 huge fridges (coldrooms) where fruits, vegetables, herbs and berries are kept.

They also trained me putting veggies on display. &#8220;Presentation is everything,&#8221; they keep reminding me. If I see any whilted leaves, or dirt, or marks, or soft spots, they fruit or vegetable either gets tossed or gets chopped up for us by the next-door deli (which is part of the same business anyways).

I plan to work about 30-35 hr/week. Boss said &#8220;It&#8217;s up to you,&#8221; so I feel good about the freedom/flexibility.

I got another job offer, for 37.5 hr/week, for over $650/week. Calculated hourly, that amounted to just a little over $16/hr. Is it worth it? I have to meet quota every  month ($17,000). Everything I sell above that, I make 10% of profit. I have to pay nearly $200 for a security check (similar to police check), and I need an International Drivers Licence. He wants me to spend more than 50% of my time on the road, meeting prosepective clients, and creating new ones. Good experience, but I don&#8217;t think it is worth my time. I would have to train + bus to work everyday. I would need to work more hours per week. And I would be earning about the same amount of money weekly (not including commissions, which I generally don&#8217;t mind, but I don&#8217;t put much faith in).

Next step is finding a Master of I.T. program that interests me, and one which I am likely to get into. If I apply through OzTrekk (Canada) my application fee of $100 is waived, and I win a $500 scholarship if I get accepted into any Uni.

A program of 1.5 years  (Masters of I.T.) to 2 years (Masters of I.T. Management) would mean I graduate at 28 years old, in 2011. Not to shabby. I.T. is growing (again) in Brisbane, Queensland, and the whole of Australia. Salaries range from (approx) $66,000 to $110,000 depending on the job. Property is costly, but grocery prices are going down, inflation is dropping. I think it is a good time to jump in and get wet.

STAY TUNED! PHOTOS COMING SOON!
