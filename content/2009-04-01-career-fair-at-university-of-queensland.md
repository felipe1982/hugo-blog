UQ held a career fair today (April 1st). I managed to talk to a few employers (Defence, Gov&#8217;t of QLD, and more) about IT related jobs. I should have done engineering, seems like were a vast proportion of the demand (jobs) are. oh well!. And in the IT realm, seems like programming and software design (engineering) are also on the strong side, with Networking beneath that, and security somewhere on the bottom üôÅ

Did grocery shopping, and fogot to get toilet paper.
