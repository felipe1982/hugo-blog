Homework is catching up with me, but I really like it like that. I&#8217;ve got cryptography maths to sort through (I&#8217;m a bit slow at maths), I&#8217;ve got assignments in Security to submit Friday. My Project Management class has an group assignment due Wednesday, and my group has not yet submitted everything to me so I can stitch all the disparate parts together. Finally, in Forensics class, we have not yet received our assignments, so I&#8217;m still waiting there.

What disappoints me is that the assignments ought to be there from Day 1.<!--more--> If an assignment is due on week 10, for example, the student should have 10 weeks to work on it. If the assignment is distributed on week 8, then the students have only 2 weeks to complete it, which I think is not a fair way to assess a students capabilities and knowledge.

My roommates are the best I&#8217;ve ever had, and I have had some nasty ones. They pay their Internet bills on time, they respect that I have to get up at 3:00am to go to work. They tend to leave their dishes around for a few hours before cleaning them, but they are usually done before nightfall, which I can live with.

I chatted on skype with my mother and sister the other day. I didn&#8217;t tell them, but I had to install **Windows** in order to get my webcam working. BTW, the webcam works in Linux, and SUSE in particular, except this newest version has had some driver problems, which should get sorted out soon. My mother was a little sad when I told her that I wasn&#8217;t sure if I would move back to Canada for good. Frankly, I don&#8217;t like the winter there. I can find work here, or anywhere warm, and I&#8217;ll be happy. Plus, I think there is a good future here, a lot of opportunities, and a lot of growth. This country is larger than Europe, with only 20 million people!

I changed by bank account from westpac to commonwealth. Westpac had too many charges. $2 here, $2.50 there. Just for an automatic weekly transfer to pay my rent was $2 each time! WTF. I said forget it! And switched to commonwealth. They charge $0. And I can even use ATM machines from different (non-Commonwealth) banks for FREE! So I&#8217;ve set it all up, now I can forget it, and rest easy.

Speaking of rest, I should be going to sleep. Gotta get up at 3am for work again. I&#8217;ll be home 1:30pm, and I leave at 5pm for my class at 6pm.

I hope you can leave a comment for me, even a short one, just so I know you&#8217;ve read and enjoyed my post.

Good night =)
