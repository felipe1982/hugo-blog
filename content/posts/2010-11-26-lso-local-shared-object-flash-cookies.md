  * they are never expiring &#8211; staying on your computer for an unlimited time.
  * by default they offer a storage of 100 KB (compare: Usual cookies 4 KB).
  * browsers are not aware of those cookies, LSO&#8217;s usually cannot be removed by browsers.
  * via Flash they can access and store highly specific personal and technical information (system, user name, .).
  * ability to send the stored information to the appropriate server, without user&#8217;s permission.
  * flash applications do not need to be visible to the user
  * there is no easy way to tell which flash-cookie sites are tracking you.
  * shared folders allow cross-browser tracking, all browsers use the same LSO folder
  * the company doesn&#8217;t provide a user-friendly way to manage LSO&#8217;s, in fact it&#8217;s incredible cumbersome.
  * many domains and tracking companies make extensive use of flash-cookies.
  * flash-cookies are used to re-create data of deleted traditional cookies.
