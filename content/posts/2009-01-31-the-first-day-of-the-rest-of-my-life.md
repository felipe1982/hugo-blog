Getting up at 4am for work was a b**tch the first day. At the end of it I was exhausted. I came home, made dinner, played online for a bit, then went to sleep about 6pm. I awoke at midnight quite refreshed but, with two hours remaining before having to official rise for work, I went back to bed.

They are training me of veggies &#8211; cutting up the caulis (cauliflower) and brock (broccoli) and displaying them in the most fantastic and aesthetically pleasing way possible. Any brown or dull spotted veggies go to _cheap_, the name they give to discounted products. Really terrible ones vanish in the _rubbish_ (don&#8217;t say &#8216;garbage&#8217; in Oz, it puzzles them).

Yvonne&#8217;s school is getting a little tougher. She had her first visit to the hospitals last week. She also got her first experience with a cadaver. Ewww, yuck!

Now what&#8217;s on my mind most is enrolling in [Master of Information Technology (Management)][1] program at University of Queensland. Obviously my prospects are open. But the situation here is positive for a number of reasons, some include:

  1. I do not have a 4-years Honours Bachelor Degree. Many Universities in Canada (and other places) do not accept Undergrads into Post-Graduate studies without Honours Bachelor Degree
  2. I have no (official) background in Computer Science or I.T. Most I.T. or Computer Science post-graduate programs require this.
  3. UQ is the 3rd best University in Australia, and the 43th best University in the world (based on the findings from the Institute of Higher Education, [Shanghai Jiao Tong University][2])

There is, I believe, a very large and growing demand for IT in Australia, and the rest of the world. Too few people have been entering into CS or IT in the last decade or so because of the industry&#8217;s decline, but too many are retiring, and too few are replacing them. In any case, I&#8217;ve got to get started on something, right? I am 26 years old, after two years of study I will be 29 (add my birthday somewhere in there) and I will hopefully find a job within one month. That is what one professor that I chatted with told me, that 99% of Masters of IT graduates found jobs within 1-2 months after graduating, and many got jobs _before_ graduation. How about that? More on him in myÂ  next blog.

Ta-ta for now,

Felipe
